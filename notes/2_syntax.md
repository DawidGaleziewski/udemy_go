# variables

# short declaration

:= we declare and assign value. We can only use the short declaration operator only inside function body
```go
x := 42
x = 5
```

we can also declare a value by var keyword. We can use var outide of function body.

```go
var z int
```

If we declare var we need to use int, but do not assign any value it will be assigned a "zereod value". Which depands on the type. 0 for int, "" for string, false for boolean
