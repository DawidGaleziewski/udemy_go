# How computers work
 -> Computers run on electricity 
 -> electiricty can have onn/off state 
 -> we can assign meaning to on and off state (coding schemes). By having multiple switches (transistors/circuits with on and off state) we can create more and more complex states.

 If we have on switch = 2 messages
If we have 2 switches = 4 messages

Due to fact each switch has 2 states we have 2^n combinations where n is the number of swithces.

Therefore:

1 switch = 2 combinations
2 switch = 4 combinations
3 switch = 8 combinations
4 switch = 16 combinations
5 switch = 32 combinations
6 switch = 64 combinations
7 switch = 128 combinations
8 switch = 256 combinations


## binary digits
one and zeros (1 0) represent on and off state and are refered to as BInary digiTS. This is where word (BITS) comes from

## coding sheme

meaning we asign to combination of on and off states i.e:
1 1 - party
1 0 - study night
0 0 - sleep

ascii is a popular coding scheme to store characters.
It uses 7 switches (128 combinations).
For example character "a" is translated to 100 0001

another popular coding scheme replacing ascii is UTF-8

## measuring bits

1 bit - one binary digit (i.e 0)
8 bits = byte
1000 byte = kb
1000 kb = mb
1000 mb = gb
1000 gb = tb

## numeral systems

system we use to track numbers.

One we use everyday is "base 10 decimal"

therefore in rows we have:

10^0, 10^1, 10^2, 10^3, 10^4, 10^5


### binary numeric system
2^0 (ones), 2^1 (twos), 2^2 (fours), 2^3 (eigths)

3 = 11
4 = 001
5 = 101

### base 16 numeric system
when we have a numeric system that are higher then 10 we go with 1-9 and go with letter of the alphabet after that

 16^3 (4,096) ,16^2 (256), 16^1, 16^0

15 = F
16 = 10
17 = 11
911 = 38f

ps. official notation for hexadecimal starts with 0x. so 911 would be 0x38f
